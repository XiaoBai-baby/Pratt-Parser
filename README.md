# Pratt-Parser
Pratt parsers are recursive descent operator precedence parsers. Such parsers are well suited to parsing expressions \
and integrate well into regular recursive descent parsers.

## Features
This project is secondary development. It employs an AI-driven converter to convert "Rust" code into "C/C++" code .

## Summary
It is not recommended to use a converter to convert the source project code into code in other languages. \
This will result in the loss of the original language's features (for example: Memory Security or Concurrent Safety), \
resulting in lead to program memory leakage or crash.
